    the following error: "This line of data is not usable: line skipped".
    It will add any data type (float or string) to the output list,

    This function completes this by running many of the previously defined

    two strings, converts the strings into floats, checks to ensure that
    both values are indeed floats, makes sure that the new list actually
    contains two values, and finally checks to see that no NaN values are
